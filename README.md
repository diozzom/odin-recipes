# odin-recipes
This project is a culmination of my HTML basics training.
I am creating a website to host my favourite recipes from across the internet.

By the end of this project I will have likely sharpened my HTML skills,
having already created several boilerplates and learned about key elements, tags,
parent-child relationships, and nesting.
